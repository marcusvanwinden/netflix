<h1>Netflix</h1>

<p><a href="https://marcusvanwinden-netflix.web.app">View project</a></p>

<p>Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows and movies. I think Netflix is a great service, and so I decided to built a Netflix clone with <b>React</b>, <b>Webpack</b>, and <b>Firebase</b>. The project is a work in progress because I regularly add new or optimize existing code. This Netflix clone looks almost identical to the original website. There is some funny content in the app for the people that log in and watch a movie ðŸ˜‰  Feel free to use '<b>demo@example.com</b>' and '<b>password</b>' as the email and password, respectively.</p>
