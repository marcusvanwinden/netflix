<h1>Netflix</h1>

<p><a href="https://marcusvanwinden-netflix.web.app">View project</a></p>

<p>Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows and movies. I think Netflix is a great service, so I built a Netflix clone with <b>React</b>, <b>Webpack</b>, and <b>Firebase</b>. This project is still in progress because I am adding new and optimizing existing code. This Netflix clone looks almost identical to the original website, has an authentication system, and allows users to search for their favorite content. There is some funny content in the app for the people that sign up and watch a movie ðŸ˜‰ Feel free to log in with '<b>demo@example.com</b>' and '<b>password</b>' as the email and password, respectively.</p>
